        <h2>Concealed in Plain Sight</h2>

        <p>In this millennial era, we've grown accustomed to sharing almost every detail of our personal lives. It's become so embedded in pop culture that we almost expect our favorite artists to be vulnerable immediately out the gate. But Emotional Oranges, a Los Angeles-based R&B duo on the rise, aren't playing into that mentality.
        <br>
        Comprised of male singer/audio engineer "A" and vocalist "V" (full names aren't essential for them), the pair met in 2017 at a bat mitzvah and discovered their mutual love for classic R&B artists like Lauryn Hill and Sad√©. From there, they formed Emotional Oranges all while keeping their identities anonymous -- wearing headgear and often being shrouded in fog onstage. That mysterious factor led to the duo's allure, shifting the focus from what they look like under those masks they don on stage to their sultry R&B tunes.</p>
